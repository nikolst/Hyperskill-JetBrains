Description
It's very upsetting when the data about registered users disappears after the program is completed. 
To avoid this problem, you need to create a database where you will store all the necessary information about the created credit cards. 
We will use SQLite to create the database.
SQLite is a database engine. It is software that allows users to interact with a relational database. 
In SQLite, a database is stored in a single file — a trait that distinguishes it from other database engines. 
This allows for greater accessibility: copying a database is no more complicated than copying the file that stores the data, 
and sharing a database implies just sending an email attachment.
You may consult the SQL tutorial website (https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-java/) to navigate the work with SQLite from Java.
You don’t have to install any libraries to work with a database — you can use it in the project without any problems.

Objectives
In this stage, create a database with a table titled card. It should have the following columns:
id INTEGER
number TEXT
pin TEXT
balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0
Also, in this stage, you should read the database file name from the command line argument. 
Filename should be passed to the program using -fileName argument, for example, -fileName db.s3db.
Pay attention: your database file should be created when the program starts, if it hasn’t yet been created. 
And all created cards should be stored in the database from now.
